# Python-Projects

Small Projects or Fun applications written in Python:

1. VCF Surgeon: Program that allows the user to select a text file with a list of variants (Positions, Ref/Alt, vaf) that they would like to add to a given VCF file, and then creates a new VCF file with the added variant rows for those variants.

2. FASTA Dup Remover: This program finds and removes FASTA reads with duplicate tags in a FASTA file, given a tag to remove (will leave one read of the given tag).

3. Gene Validator: Text list comparison script that takes two lists of genes as inputs; compares one list 1 against list 2 (index) to determine if there are any gene names in list 1 that are NOT in list 2.
